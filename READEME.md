# HomeKit Accessory Protocol Library
This library will enable your C++ application to expose HomeKit accessories compliant with the latest non-commercial HAP protocol specification. Current implementation will be able to interact with Apple HomeKit application exploting the HTTP protocol to expose a single accessory or an accessory bridge with multiple accessories.

# Still work in progress
The library is still under development, first working release is almost ready, but there are some missing and/or untested parts to be completed so be patient.

# Contacts
Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any hints about the code or implementation: the idea is to develop a library with a simple and intuitive interface preventing the user from all the complex stuff about HAP protocol.

### Legal Notice
This library is intended for private use only, for commercial implementation of the HAP protocol just refer to official Apple documentation. If in any case there are some violation please contact me immediately and I'll take care of fixing what is needed.
